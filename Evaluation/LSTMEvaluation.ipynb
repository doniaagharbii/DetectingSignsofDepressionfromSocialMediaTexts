       "95  venting i was in a relationship for years and it ended last spring im over it it was the most serious id ever felt about someone we just mutually agreed to break it off and go other she helped me realize i go through if depression and i need to handle it so i am i think she cared about me more than anyone in my life ever had and now that its gone i feel empty its not one of those crawl back to her deals cause we just dont work together but now it feels like it meant way more to me than it ever did to her shortly after i moved out she literally got rid of all my stuff that i had to leave i explicitly told her my mom would come get it and some of it i wanted to have but she literally acted like i never mentioned that and just of it all i for the first time since i was a teenager cried my eyes out i cried so hard she sent me as a sorry like that covered anything my shoes dress clothes all gone it was so personal she will never realize how awful that was to do and it kills me inside how easily she did it she has no idea how that made me feel nor would she care a few months went by after i moved out and she forgot my birthday didnt even say anything until a few days after yet on her birthday literally weeks after i moved out i acknowledged hers once again this destroyed me a person who told me times they wanted to stay in touch and be friends cause of how close weve been for so long completely forgets i exist these events have led me to resent her and i hate it a month after i moved out she text that she was seeing someone i thought wow how fast then a few months later she fails to remember she told me that while texting me about some new dentist guy shes seeing how he had a daughter near the same age as mine making okay now i get it its easy to forget me and of my things when you have the hots for a new guy it made sense and yet again i think on all the time we spent together and things we did and wonder why did they mean more to me than her how can someone so easily of another and be so blind to what theyre doing ive had the worst luck of my life since i moved away i cant even begin none of you would believe it all i can do is shake my head and tell myself it has to get better this many bad things cant keep happening to a single person giving so much effort and trying so hard to succeed surely it has to end but here i am i feel resentment and regret towards her now i dont want to but its the actions after the ending to this day she never realize how much i sacrificed and gave up to be with her that i never fully recovered from my depression won and back then i didnt even realize it was depression i wish i had never been in the army either thats something else entirely today after years a friend told me basically i am just one of many said im not unique or special to them and said it in such a weird way and i realized they were distancing themselves from me what i felt about them was entirely different and i actually feel pain right now like im hurt and and i dont know what to do anymore my childhood was awful being beat to finding out your step dad kept a child porn stash while his best friend was sexually abusing his daughters i dont think ive ever told anyone about that just the i took my entire life has been violent im i dont have any life long friends or people that check on me other then my mother today i have realized i am truly alone hoping the goes out long enough for me to dry out and catch something good or positive right now im and barely getting by i think people use me until theyre no longer satisfied then of me im not even on a self pity trip i think its just what it is and im coming to terms ill never have the balls to end my own life i just cant do that and sometimes i envy people that can i dont need any hang in there dms or eye of the im just venting i dont have anyone to talk to or any way to give context of my life for anyone to understand anyways so im just saying what i have bottled inside she couldve said happy birthday she made so many changes so fast right after i hit the door and here i was trying to be strong for her when really she couldve my my cat stays with her too i miss my cat so bad just another thing i have to let go   \n",
