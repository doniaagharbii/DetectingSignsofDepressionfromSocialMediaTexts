       "95  venting i was in a relationship for years and it ended last spring im over it it was the most serious id ever felt about someone we just mutually agreed to break it off and go other she helped me realize i go through if depression and i need to handle it so i am i think she cared about me more than anyone in my life ever had and now that its gone i feel empty its not one of those crawl back to her deals cause we just dont work together but now it feels like it meant way more to me than it ever did to her shortly after i moved out she literally got rid of all my stuff that i had to leave i explicitly told her my mom would come get it and some of it i wanted to have but she literally acted like i never mentioned that and just of it all i for the first time since i was a teenager cried my eyes out i cried so hard she sent me as a sorry like that covered anything my shoes dress clothes all gone it was so personal she will never realize how awful that was to do and it kills me inside how easily she did it she has no idea how that made me feel nor would she care a few months went by after i moved out and she forgot my birthday didnt even say anything until a few days after yet on her birthday literally weeks after i moved out i acknowledged hers once again this destroyed me a person who told me times they wanted to stay in touch and be friends cause of how close weve been for so long completely forgets i exist these events have led me to resent her and i hate it a month after i moved out she text that she was seeing someone i thought wow how fast then a few months later she fails to remember she told me that while texting me about some new dentist guy shes seeing how he had a daughter near the same age as mine making okay now i get it its easy to forget me and of my things when you have the hots for a new guy it made sense and yet again i think on all the time we spent together and things we did and wonder why did they mean more to me than her how can someone so easily of another and be so blind to what theyre doing ive had the worst luck of my life since i moved away i cant even begin none of you would believe it all i can do is shake my head and tell myself it has to get better this many bad things cant keep happening to a single person giving so much effort and trying so hard to succeed surely it has to end but here i am i feel resentment and regret towards her now i dont want to but its the actions after the ending to this day she never realize how much i sacrificed and gave up to be with her that i never fully recovered from my depression won and back then i didnt even realize it was depression i wish i had never been in the army either thats something else entirely today after years a friend told me basically i am just one of many said im not unique or special to them and said it in such a weird way and i realized they were distancing themselves from me what i felt about them was entirely different and i actually feel pain right now like im hurt and and i dont know what to do anymore my childhood was awful being beat to finding out your step dad kept a child porn stash while his best friend was sexually abusing his daughters i dont think ive ever told anyone about that just the i took my entire life has been violent im i dont have any life long friends or people that check on me other then my mother today i have realized i am truly alone hoping the goes out long enough for me to dry out and catch something good or positive right now im and barely getting by i think people use me until theyre no longer satisfied then of me im not even on a self pity trip i think its just what it is and im coming to terms ill never have the balls to end my own life i just cant do that and sometimes i envy people that can i dont need any hang in there dms or eye of the im just venting i dont have anyone to talk to or any way to give context of my life for anyone to understand anyways so im just saying what i have bottled inside she couldve said happy birthday she made so many changes so fast right after i hit the door and here i was trying to be strong for her when really she couldve my my cat stays with her too i miss my cat so bad just another thing i have to let go   \n",

       "95  venting i was in a relationship for years and it ended last spring im over it it was the most serious id ever felt about someone we just mutually agreed to break it off and go other she helped me realize i go through if depression and i need to handle it so i am i think she cared about me more than anyone in my life ever had and now that its gone i feel empty its not one of those crawl back to her deals cause we just dont work together but now it feels like it meant way more to me than it ever did to her shortly after i moved out she literally got rid of all my stuff that i had to leave i explicitly told her my mom would come get it and some of it i wanted to have but she literally acted like i never mentioned that and just of it all i for the first time since i was a teenager cried my eyes out i cried so hard she sent me as a sorry like that covered anything my shoes dress clothes all gone it was so personal she will never realize how awful that was to do and it kills me inside how easily she did it she has no idea how that made me feel nor would she care a few months went by after i moved out and she forgot my birthday didnt even say anything until a few days after yet on her birthday literally weeks after i moved out i acknowledged hers once again this destroyed me a person who told me times they wanted to stay in touch and be friends cause of how close weve been for so long completely forgets i exist these events have led me to resent her and i hate it a month after i moved out she text that she was seeing someone i thought wow how fast then a few months later she fails to remember she told me that while texting me about some new dentist guy shes seeing how he had a daughter near the same age as mine making okay now i get it its easy to forget me and of my things when you have the hots for a new guy it made sense and yet again i think on all the time we spent together and things we did and wonder why did they mean more to me than her how can someone so easily of another and be so blind to what theyre doing ive had the worst luck of my life since i moved away i cant even begin none of you would believe it all i can do is shake my head and tell myself it has to get better this many bad things cant keep happening to a single person giving so much effort and trying so hard to succeed surely it has to end but here i am i feel resentment and regret towards her now i dont want to but its the actions after the ending to this day she never realize how much i sacrificed and gave up to be with her that i never fully recovered from my depression won and back then i didnt even realize it was depression i wish i had never been in the army either thats something else entirely today after years a friend told me basically i am just one of many said im not unique or special to them and said it in such a weird way and i realized they were distancing themselves from me what i felt about them was entirely different and i actually feel pain right now like im hurt and and i dont know what to do anymore my childhood was awful being beat to finding out your step dad kept a child porn stash while his best friend was sexually abusing his daughters i dont think ive ever told anyone about that just the i took my entire life has been violent im i dont have any life long friends or people that check on me other then my mother today i have realized i am truly alone hoping the goes out long enough for me to dry out and catch something good or positive right now im and barely getting by i think people use me until theyre no longer satisfied then of me im not even on a self pity trip i think its just what it is and im coming to terms ill never have the balls to end my own life i just cant do that and sometimes i envy people that can i dont need any hang in there dms or eye of the im just venting i dont have anyone to talk to or any way to give context of my life for anyone to understand anyways so im just saying what i have bottled inside she couldve said happy birthday she made so many changes so fast right after i hit the door and here i was trying to be strong for her when really she couldve my my cat stays with her too i miss my cat so bad just another thing i have to let go   \n",

       "95  venting i was in a relationship for years and it ended last spring im over it it was the most serious id ever felt about someone we just mutually agreed to break it off and go other she helped me realize i go through if depression and i need to handle it so i am i think she cared about me more than anyone in my life ever had and now that its gone i feel empty its not one of those crawl back to her deals cause we just dont work together but now it feels like it meant way more to me than it ever did to her shortly after i moved out she literally got rid of all my stuff that i had to leave i explicitly told her my mom would come get it and some of it i wanted to have but she literally acted like i never mentioned that and just of it all i for the first time since i was a teenager cried my eyes out i cried so hard she sent me as a sorry like that covered anything my shoes dress clothes all gone it was so personal she will never realize how awful that was to do and it kills me inside how easily she did it she has no idea how that made me feel nor would she care a few months went by after i moved out and she forgot my birthday didnt even say anything until a few days after yet on her birthday literally weeks after i moved out i acknowledged hers once again this destroyed me a person who told me times they wanted to stay in touch and be friends cause of how close weve been for so long completely forgets i exist these events have led me to resent her and i hate it a month after i moved out she text that she was seeing someone i thought wow how fast then a few months later she fails to remember she told me that while texting me about some new dentist guy shes seeing how he had a daughter near the same age as mine making okay now i get it its easy to forget me and of my things when you have the hots for a new guy it made sense and yet again i think on all the time we spent together and things we did and wonder why did they mean more to me than her how can someone so easily of another and be so blind to what theyre doing ive had the worst luck of my life since i moved away i cant even begin none of you would believe it all i can do is shake my head and tell myself it has to get better this many bad things cant keep happening to a single person giving so much effort and trying so hard to succeed surely it has to end but here i am i feel resentment and regret towards her now i dont want to but its the actions after the ending to this day she never realize how much i sacrificed and gave up to be with her that i never fully recovered from my depression won and back then i didnt even realize it was depression i wish i had never been in the army either thats something else entirely today after years a friend told me basically i am just one of many said im not unique or special to them and said it in such a weird way and i realized they were distancing themselves from me what i felt about them was entirely different and i actually feel pain right now like im hurt and and i dont know what to do anymore my childhood was awful being beat to finding out your step dad kept a child porn stash while his best friend was sexually abusing his daughters i dont think ive ever told anyone about that just the i took my entire life has been violent im i dont have any life long friends or people that check on me other then my mother today i have realized i am truly alone hoping the goes out long enough for me to dry out and catch something good or positive right now im and barely getting by i think people use me until theyre no longer satisfied then of me im not even on a self pity trip i think its just what it is and im coming to terms ill never have the balls to end my own life i just cant do that and sometimes i envy people that can i dont need any hang in there dms or eye of the im just venting i dont have anyone to talk to or any way to give context of my life for anyone to understand anyways so im just saying what i have bottled inside she couldve said happy birthday she made so many changes so fast right after i hit the door and here i was trying to be strong for her when really she couldve my my cat stays with her too i miss my cat so bad just another thing i have to let go   \n",

       "71  yes im clingy and im sorry ive always been the clingy type and ive always been criticized for it main reason i am such is because i wasnt shown hardly any physically affection when i was young i can barely recall my parents having ever hugged me as a child and even when they did it was usually awkward and knowing who they really are now makes me wonder if any of it was even genuine either way being clingy is not something society is fond of its as annoying stupid childish unnecessary etc and ive had people say it to me like my dad saying you shouldnt cling to your sister in law like that it gets on her nerves and she is the type to literally shake my hand off if i try to hold her hand so i eventually stopped trying a couple friends of mine dont like physically contact much so they are the type to actually push you off if you touch them like my one friend literally shouted nope and her hand away when i tried once and the other friend had to give me a talk about it after asking her mom how to approach me on the matter i get it not everyone likes that and i respect the people who dont even when they express it in a rude or manner but boy does it really add to my self hate even my one friend who doesnt mind it will say things like i know youre clingy and shes right i am she may mean no harm by saying it but that doesnt mean it doesnt do harm regardless and now people arent allowed to touch each other due to the coronavirus going around but at this point who cares i never got physical affection before anyway why would i worry about it now at least thats what i tell myself and others i laugh it off i respect others wishes and space i brush it off and pretend like it doesnt hurt but it really really really does especially when i havent been shown any affection by the people who were supposed to care the most i remember reading an article on a life story he had a horrid childhood and almost died as a result of his parents neglecting him he mentioned how he remembered being a little boy in his crib and hed his eyes out when came by just because he wanted to be held but everyone ignored him id never cried after reading something like that before but i did im crying just writing about it now and i did because it struck a cord with me i cant remember anything really specific but i do know there were times all i wanted was to be held reassured by my parents like any child should be but i wasnt i was pushed away yelled at and called clingy and they were right i was i am and im sorry im really truly sorry im sorry wasnt shown enough love as child im sorry i dont have many real friends who understand my feelings im sorry i was wasnt even kept by the parents that actually created me and will probably never know them im sorry i ended up adopted by a family who didnt really care and im sorry all those things made me who i am i dont want to be clingy i never wanted to be im sorry i am i wish i wasnt i wish i wasnt me i wish i was dead and then i wouldnt have be this thing that people despise again sorry to all the people that have labeled me as clingy i you when i die i wont be ever again   \n",

       "95  venting i was in a relationship for years and it ended last spring im over it it was the most serious id ever felt about someone we just mutually agreed to break it off and go other she helped me realize i go through if depression and i need to handle it so i am i think she cared about me more than anyone in my life ever had and now that its gone i feel empty its not one of those crawl back to her deals cause we just dont work together but now it feels like it meant way more to me than it ever did to her shortly after i moved out she literally got rid of all my stuff that i had to leave i explicitly told her my mom would come get it and some of it i wanted to have but she literally acted like i never mentioned that and just of it all i for the first time since i was a teenager cried my eyes out i cried so hard she sent me as a sorry like that covered anything my shoes dress clothes all gone it was so personal she will never realize how awful that was to do and it kills me inside how easily she did it she has no idea how that made me feel nor would she care a few months went by after i moved out and she forgot my birthday didnt even say anything until a few days after yet on her birthday literally weeks after i moved out i acknowledged hers once again this destroyed me a person who told me times they wanted to stay in touch and be friends cause of how close weve been for so long completely forgets i exist these events have led me to resent her and i hate it a month after i moved out she text that she was seeing someone i thought wow how fast then a few months later she fails to remember she told me that while texting me about some new dentist guy shes seeing how he had a daughter near the same age as mine making okay now i get it its easy to forget me and of my things when you have the hots for a new guy it made sense and yet again i think on all the time we spent together and things we did and wonder why did they mean more to me than her how can someone so easily of another and be so blind to what theyre doing ive had the worst luck of my life since i moved away i cant even begin none of you would believe it all i can do is shake my head and tell myself it has to get better this many bad things cant keep happening to a single person giving so much effort and trying so hard to succeed surely it has to end but here i am i feel resentment and regret towards her now i dont want to but its the actions after the ending to this day she never realize how much i sacrificed and gave up to be with her that i never fully recovered from my depression won and back then i didnt even realize it was depression i wish i had never been in the army either thats something else entirely today after years a friend told me basically i am just one of many said im not unique or special to them and said it in such a weird way and i realized they were distancing themselves from me what i felt about them was entirely different and i actually feel pain right now like im hurt and and i dont know what to do anymore my childhood was awful being beat to finding out your step dad kept a child porn stash while his best friend was sexually abusing his daughters i dont think ive ever told anyone about that just the i took my entire life has been violent im i dont have any life long friends or people that check on me other then my mother today i have realized i am truly alone hoping the goes out long enough for me to dry out and catch something good or positive right now im and barely getting by i think people use me until theyre no longer satisfied then of me im not even on a self pity trip i think its just what it is and im coming to terms ill never have the balls to end my own life i just cant do that and sometimes i envy people that can i dont need any hang in there dms or eye of the im just venting i dont have anyone to talk to or any way to give context of my life for anyone to understand anyways so im just saying what i have bottled inside she couldve said happy birthday she made so many changes so fast right after i hit the door and here i was trying to be strong for her when really she couldve my my cat stays with her too i miss my cat so bad just another thing i have to let go   \n",

       "71  yes im clingy and im sorry ive always been the clingy type and ive always been criticized for it main reason i am such is because i wasnt shown hardly any physically affection when i was young i can barely recall my parents having ever hugged me as a child and even when they did it was usually awkward and knowing who they really are now makes me wonder if any of it was even genuine either way being clingy is not something society is fond of its as annoying stupid childish unnecessary etc and ive had people say it to me like my dad saying you shouldnt cling to your sister in law like that it gets on her nerves and she is the type to literally shake my hand off if i try to hold her hand so i eventually stopped trying a couple friends of mine dont like physically contact much so they are the type to actually push you off if you touch them like my one friend literally shouted nope and her hand away when i tried once and the other friend had to give me a talk about it after asking her mom how to approach me on the matter i get it not everyone likes that and i respect the people who dont even when they express it in a rude or manner but boy does it really add to my self hate even my one friend who doesnt mind it will say things like i know youre clingy and shes right i am she may mean no harm by saying it but that doesnt mean it doesnt do harm regardless and now people arent allowed to touch each other due to the coronavirus going around but at this point who cares i never got physical affection before anyway why would i worry about it now at least thats what i tell myself and others i laugh it off i respect others wishes and space i brush it off and pretend like it doesnt hurt but it really really really does especially when i havent been shown any affection by the people who were supposed to care the most i remember reading an article on a life story he had a horrid childhood and almost died as a result of his parents neglecting him he mentioned how he remembered being a little boy in his crib and hed his eyes out when came by just because he wanted to be held but everyone ignored him id never cried after reading something like that before but i did im crying just writing about it now and i did because it struck a cord with me i cant remember anything really specific but i do know there were times all i wanted was to be held reassured by my parents like any child should be but i wasnt i was pushed away yelled at and called clingy and they were right i was i am and im sorry im really truly sorry im sorry wasnt shown enough love as child im sorry i dont have many real friends who understand my feelings im sorry i was wasnt even kept by the parents that actually created me and will probably never know them im sorry i ended up adopted by a family who didnt really care and im sorry all those things made me who i am i dont want to be clingy i never wanted to be im sorry i am i wish i wasnt i wish i wasnt me i wish i was dead and then i wouldnt have be this thing that people despise again sorry to all the people that have labeled me as clingy i you when i die i wont be ever again   \n",

       "71  yes im clingy and im sorry ive always been the clingy type and ive always been criticized for it main reason i am such is because i wasnt shown hardly any physically affection when i was young i can barely recall my parents having ever hugged me as a child and even when they did it was usually awkward and knowing who they really are now makes me wonder if any of it was even genuine either way being clingy is not something society is fond of its as annoying stupid childish unnecessary etc and ive had people say it to me like my dad saying you shouldnt cling to your sister in law like that it gets on her nerves and she is the type to literally shake my hand off if i try to hold her hand so i eventually stopped trying a couple friends of mine dont like physically contact much so they are the type to actually push you off if you touch them like my one friend literally shouted nope and her hand away when i tried once and the other friend had to give me a talk about it after asking her mom how to approach me on the matter i get it not everyone likes that and i respect the people who dont even when they express it in a rude or manner but boy does it really add to my self hate even my one friend who doesnt mind it will say things like i know youre clingy and shes right i am she may mean no harm by saying it but that doesnt mean it doesnt do harm regardless and now people arent allowed to touch each other due to the coronavirus going around but at this point who cares i never got physical affection before anyway why would i worry about it now at least thats what i tell myself and others i laugh it off i respect others wishes and space i brush it off and pretend like it doesnt hurt but it really really really does especially when i havent been shown any affection by the people who were supposed to care the most i remember reading an article on a life story he had a horrid childhood and almost died as a result of his parents neglecting him he mentioned how he remembered being a little boy in his crib and hed his eyes out when came by just because he wanted to be held but everyone ignored him id never cried after reading something like that before but i did im crying just writing about it now and i did because it struck a cord with me i cant remember anything really specific but i do know there were times all i wanted was to be held reassured by my parents like any child should be but i wasnt i was pushed away yelled at and called clingy and they were right i was i am and im sorry im really truly sorry im sorry wasnt shown enough love as child im sorry i dont have many real friends who understand my feelings im sorry i was wasnt even kept by the parents that actually created me and will probably never know them im sorry i ended up adopted by a family who didnt really care and im sorry all those things made me who i am i dont want to be clingy i never wanted to be im sorry i am i wish i wasnt i wish i wasnt me i wish i was dead and then i wouldnt have be this thing that people despise again sorry to all the people that have labeled me as clingy i you when i die i wont be ever again   \n",

       "71  yes im clingy and im sorry ive always been the clingy type and ive always been criticized for it main reason i am such is because i wasnt shown hardly any physically affection when i was young i can barely recall my parents having ever hugged me as a child and even when they did it was usually awkward and knowing who they really are now makes me wonder if any of it was even genuine either way being clingy is not something society is fond of its as annoying stupid childish unnecessary etc and ive had people say it to me like my dad saying you shouldnt cling to your sister in law like that it gets on her nerves and she is the type to literally shake my hand off if i try to hold her hand so i eventually stopped trying a couple friends of mine dont like physically contact much so they are the type to actually push you off if you touch them like my one friend literally shouted nope and her hand away when i tried once and the other friend had to give me a talk about it after asking her mom how to approach me on the matter i get it not everyone likes that and i respect the people who dont even when they express it in a rude or manner but boy does it really add to my self hate even my one friend who doesnt mind it will say things like i know youre clingy and shes right i am she may mean no harm by saying it but that doesnt mean it doesnt do harm regardless and now people arent allowed to touch each other due to the coronavirus going around but at this point who cares i never got physical affection before anyway why would i worry about it now at least thats what i tell myself and others i laugh it off i respect others wishes and space i brush it off and pretend like it doesnt hurt but it really really really does especially when i havent been shown any affection by the people who were supposed to care the most i remember reading an article on a life story he had a horrid childhood and almost died as a result of his parents neglecting him he mentioned how he remembered being a little boy in his crib and hed his eyes out when came by just because he wanted to be held but everyone ignored him id never cried after reading something like that before but i did im crying just writing about it now and i did because it struck a cord with me i cant remember anything really specific but i do know there were times all i wanted was to be held reassured by my parents like any child should be but i wasnt i was pushed away yelled at and called clingy and they were right i was i am and im sorry im really truly sorry im sorry wasnt shown enough love as child im sorry i dont have many real friends who understand my feelings im sorry i was wasnt even kept by the parents that actually created me and will probably never know them im sorry i ended up adopted by a family who didnt really care and im sorry all those things made me who i am i dont want to be clingy i never wanted to be im sorry i am i wish i wasnt i wish i wasnt me i wish i was dead and then i wouldnt have be this thing that people despise again sorry to all the people that have labeled me as clingy i you when i die i wont be ever again   \n",
