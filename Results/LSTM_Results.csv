fuck left abusive relationship moved in with abusive family put on disability in april constant health issues and drs and labs with no answers except maybe slight b deficiency no immunity to mumps just got the booster yesterday pt for two different pains chiropractor x a week passed out twice in a week due to weight loss was last year and down to can't gain weight to save my life wake up every morning in constant pain and nausea making it hard to eat and have energy stopped talking to my father's side of the family due to the mental abuse but still pressured by my mom to fix things before my grandmother gets old and passes away fiance lost his job in september and hasn't been able to get another even with dropped charges lost our first pregnancy the same week struggled to get through first semester of medical billing classes online maxed out credit cards to pay rent and utilities can't pay cc bills piling up and medical bills in collections spent a quiet christmas together that turned to hell the day after when we had to put one of our cats to sleep due to heart failure which was traumatic to see and decide to end his suffering after two different vet offices almost ruined relatioship with mom she was on vacation and i felt like she needed to be aware of it because he was supposed to go to her next year can't afford pain meds or anything at this point my car is paid off but dead and needs work we can't afford just not sure if i can deal with this anymore lease is up at the end of march and we can't afford staying here rn but can't afford another deposit anywhere else no family in fl to stay with and can't afford relocation even if offered a job out of state trying to sell everything i own for as little as possible to get rid of the physical and emotional baggage and to pay rent utilities other debts pretty much exhausted everything and just wondering if this is the end of line for us i'm scared of ended up homeless and losing our pets they are the only thing we have rn really the only thing that gets me out of bed everyday to take care of them and love them with what little i have left in me losing my boy after christmas broke me completely and i just don't think next year or next decade is worth suffering through i don't want to deal with more doctors that won't find anything because most of it is probably stress related and they can't do anything about that i don't know if it's worth starting the classes i signed up for if we end up homeless and without a way for me to take my online classes i just don't know i'm scared and tired and can't continue living life this way every day feels like living hell my body is absolutely useless and i hate it i'm useless to everyone including myself and more of a burden than anythingthis isn't living

huh i could do that youre not special or something like that and all my flaws are pointed out right in my face and im ridiculed for far too long for it whether its by someone else or my own stupid brain i just never feel like im worth anything everyone else is out there living their best lives while im just not im in my second semester of college now and i still dont have a major im doing gen eds at a community college so im not wasting my money lower your and im honestly just scared to death i dont know what i want with my life because my whole life as of late has been me trying my hardest to keep my happy face on for my friends i would be more vocal but i already have another friend who is pretty vocal and i dont really wanna steal her thunder there not saying we dont support her though i just dont wanna double the burden or make her feel unimportant in her problems i just dont know anymore basically everyone around me has goals aspirations hopes dreams and smiles all round and all i have is my best fake smile and a personal mantra of a positive attitude makes for a positive day even though thats really not working honestly just im trying so hard to be something worthwhile but i just dont feel like its happening and the worst thing is that i dont know if this is just me overreacting or if its actually depression ive never told anyone this stuff and ive never gone and actually gotten tested to know for sure so i dont even know that sorry thats a lot and that was probably mostly completely word vomit ill cut myself off there theres more bothering me just like anyone else im sure but i dont have the time to go on nor do probably any of you that read this whole thing have the patience but thank you for reading this though it was nice to get this out of

m i give up on making friends long post my life has really been on a complete downwards spiral ever since i was years old when i was everything was perfect i was involved in sports band had a best friend and many other friends let's go through a timeline of what's happened to me since then years old it's the first week of th grade and all my friends have left me for no reason including my best friend i sit alone all the time during lunch and walk around the field doing nothing during recess but i assume these people that no longer talk to me are just immature and try to think that they were taken out of my life for a good reason years old middle school has started yeah i'm still alone all the time i try to keep that same attitude i had before though years old i pulled out from the public school i was going to and decided to do an online program getting up at am five days a week and spending hours a day at school doing work i could do in hours felt pointless because i was getting a's in all of my classes and had no friends to hang out with oh and my parents got divorced this year lots of fighting right in front of me and lots of having to choose sides in certain situations definitely great things for me to see and great situations to put me in years old really nothing this year actually still okay doing online schooling still no friends though years old i'm still okay doing the online program because i know that being a freshman at a public school will be hell for someone like me however i finally try to get out there and make friends i join my local group with expectations that there will be some like minded kids that i can hang out with sometimes i thought that i had no social skills after having no friends for years it was sad to see these kids try and

few months of school i can't even remember everyone i sat with i'm not at any table i don't fit in at any of these tables my social skills are flat out embarrassing i'm almost ready to just give up on ever making friends in my life and just accept it as a fact three weeks ago three kids randomly started hanging out with me everyday at lunch they were so nice to me i thought it finally was over i felt happy for the first time in a long time they cut off contract with me two weeks ago for no reason and now walk past me without saying anything to me when i asked them why they did this they said i don't know softly and walked away this is why i've been crying all weekend and especially today i give up now on making friends,moderate,moderate,"including (0.02042398788034916), old

its impossible for me to not rely on the company of other people to keep me happy hi all female in her late teens here theres a tldr too long didnt read it at the end of this post for the short and up version but for more details read the full post if possible thanks i hope youre all having a good day so i know everyone always says not to rely on others for happiness but i find it literally impossible i have hardly any friends anyways but when i have a falling out with one of them or if i get ghosted by someone i develop a friendship with online etc i fall into the worst state of depression for days it sounds really sad i know but does anyone else have this same problem where you just feel like you cant be happy or even feel decent without talking to friends or a romantic partner or any ideas on how to cope with feeling sad without having to rely on talking to my friends ive gotten suggestions like play video games go to the gym read a book etc as suggestions to keep myself occupied but none of those really help me unfortunately also another thing how do some of you guys cope with being ghosted by someone that you really enjoyed talking to felt a connection with for me its difficult to just get over it because i get attached to new people friends easily and it sucks because internet friendships only really last so long for the most part before you either get ghosted entirely or just fall out of contact its part of the whole trying not to rely on others thing for me because when i get ghosted by someone it hurts and depresses the fuck me for a long ass time any advice and or help would be much appreciated thanks for reading if you made it this far tldr how should i try and cope with not feeling so depressed without relying on talking to friends to keep me happy thats usually the only thing that stops me from breaking down is talking to one of the few friends that i still have would appreciate some advice suggestions thanks,not

how do i know if i should seek help around january last year i started to feel really down and lost most motivation i had going in life i was a straight a student and always had such a strong drive to do well and within the span of a few months everything came crashing down for me i lost all motivation could barely get out of bed in the morning and either felt apathetic or just sad i rarely genuinely laugh anymore and my happiness feels like something i project to the world rather then an actual feeling i went through a few periods like that before everything fell apart but it never stuck around except the summer before for a whole month i just went apathetic since then its just stuck around sometimes its easier and i can manage but some days i can barely make it through the school day without being on the verge of tears i knew i had some mild anxiety problems before that so i just blamed it on that but it feels a bit different honestly when it started i resorted to sh sometimes for stress relief sometimes just to feel something im a few months clean now but the pressure has been getting overwhelming and its hard not to again ive gone through periods of drinking to make the feeling go away too but ive been staying away from that so far ive started skipping classes really bad and occasionally just not going and telling everyone im sick cause it just feel awful ive been told its just teenage hormones and shit and a bunch of other stuff but when i go on here and talk to others with those issues i feel i share similar feelings but often for them its cause of depression but as for me i dont know i dont want to be one of those cases where i just seem like an attention or such or like im overreacting im just not sure what to do is it a possibility should i

decade on change for my generation but i havent dont anything never been kissed held hands complimented looked at and it doesnt help that im a dark skin girl and nowadays boys and men seem to go out of their way especially black men to point out how they believe dark skin girls are unattractive in all ways i just feel behind i mean the girl i was talking about was the girl i did everything with in elementary and middle school till we moved for high school and she had the most basic things that i cant even get i mean high schoolers get to yall about relationships and me im here too ugly to

assuming it was exhaustion now im off i feel like its gotten worse spending time with people annoys me i dont find joy in anything i do i literally sleep and watch videos all day i havent left the house or showered for a week because i havent needed to i assume that everyone hates me because i am so dull i thought the break would refresh me but i was just using work to cover up what i assume to be a deep depression looking back the reason i put so many hours in is because i didnt want to have to deal with my life at all i wanted excuses to not socialise i feel like a shell of a human more robotic than anything else i just wanted to get this off my chest because i dont know what im going to do i cant talk to anyone about this and i have extremely bad experiences with doctors when ive

a faggot my grandmother passed away and i talked to some of my friends about my mental issues hoping it would help only for them to get mad at me for making them deal with my shit and now they make fun of me for cutting my arms theyve also stopped inviting me to hang out with them and finding out theyre all together and never even told me really hurt the worst fucking thing of all was my close friend and one of the only people i trust because he was actually supportive of me when i came out to him and told him about my problems moved to a different country and he invited all of us to hang out with him one more time but i missed it because i was out sick from school and didnt use my phone so he had no way of contacting me which i feel really fucking guilty about and i missed what could have actually been a nice fucking day i dont even feel optimistic about because itll probably be even worse i dont know why im posting all of this i just wanted to get it out and theres no one i trust

i don't pray i grew up in a very christian household we had good times for a while but then when it got bad it got bad there was emotional and verbal abuses alcoholism and plenty of other grievances to fall back onto to blame for my mental health in life after but through all that my mother was there she supported me and cared for me when i couldn't or didn't know how she would call me her rock because i kept her happy calm and stable but as time has gone on i've realized she was much more mine than i hers i've struggled with depression since i was years old and thoughts of suicide since i'm now and through all these years my mom has been there for me this last year i got my heart broken lost pets my job but she was always there for me throughout ready to pick me up and give me a hug or tell me everything would be okay that these pains and episodes of mental anguish would pass and she was always right i wanted to buy her a house and give her grandchildren buy her her dream car and get her some property to have a garden i wanted to become a success so she'd never have to work another day in her life but i failed that i took my time telling myself there was plenty and i'd do it all some day my mom died three weeks ago there was no hints or build up she was healthy one day and then i woke up into a dream i couldn't fall asleep in my family is small group of friends even smaller as the days passed i took note of how many left my sphere close friends i was there for are nowhere to be found i lost religion a long time ago i don't pray but i prayed in that hospital the hours waiting outside during surgery i promised i'd be better i promised i'd go to church every sunday for the rest of my days i cried and begged and pleaded and it all went unanswered i felt like a fool she would have never wanted me on my knees like that but i had to try and try i did the silence is deafening for i am king leper where are my toes,moderate,moderate,"call (0.021689647808670998),

how do you get the courage to speak out just gone over years of depression i say that like i have been diagnosed but i am yet to go seek help so i guess let me rephrase it as years of an internal struggle its started way back in late when i started to feel this kinda change in me like nothing or no one interested me anymore i am aware i should seek the necessary help but my life is just a little too complicated for that for starters there is my family i cannot begin to imagine how i would even start a conversation about this then there is my mum who is just my world she is a deeply pious women and i recall a vivid conversation we had about mental illness and do you know what she told me she said there is no where in the holy book i wont say which cause its not that important that has anything on mental illness you tilt only ways youre crazy or youre stressed i remember feeling unsettled by this as i try to understand her but ultimately it broke my heart because i came to the realisation she could never understand the complexity of mental illness so i stayed quite for years and i guess i have been staying quite ever since and buried it within me but i am currently feeling the worst i have ever felt in my life and i dont know i dont want to feel alone anymore sorry for waffling but i wanted to ask how does someone blurt this out,moderate,moderate,"help

empty and stuck in a loop every day in any order i watch youtube then when i'm tired of it i look at animes then i need to look at some mangas when i'm bored of watching things i play video games when i'm done with those things i take a look at people's opinions in different posts like reddit while listening to some dumb music that vibes with my nostalgic mystic feelings and the cycle continues rare occasions i try to do something more meaningful like learning a language or drawing or learn the piano or take a walk or something but it doesn't last even if i want to somehow i feel hatred to continue with this productive procedure i don't find much pleasure in those things because i always have that feeling of emptiness this emptiness or hopelessness makes me quit school my job and some random activities anger sadness jealousy and emptiness became my being but i still have my kind soul i would like to think i thought i could have become emotionally dead to counter my depressed state but it didn't work but it did help a little with my anxiety and to confront a situation i guess now i'll try to find a way to get this feeling of satisfaction to live through my life which i'm really disappointed with these addictive habits to escape life don't work anymore i feel like if i don't do something about it my future is death by my own hands without hesitation i'll try to once again to

yes im clingy and im sorry ive always been the clingy type and ive always been criticized for it main reason i am such is because i wasnt shown hardly any physically affection when i was young i can barely recall my parents having ever hugged me as a child and even when they did it was usually awkward and knowing who they really are now makes me wonder if any of it was even genuine either way being clingy is not something society is fond of its as annoying stupid childish unnecessary etc and ive had people say it to me like my dad saying you shouldnt cling to your sister in law like that it gets on her nerves and she is the type to literally shake my hand off if i try to hold her hand so i eventually stopped trying a couple friends of mine dont like physically contact much so they are the type to actually push you off if you touch them like my one friend literally shouted nope and her hand away when i tried once and the other friend had to give me a talk about it after asking her mom how to approach me on the matter i get it not everyone likes that and i respect the people who dont even when they express it in a rude or manner but boy does it really add to my self hate even my one friend who doesnt mind it will say things like i know youre clingy and shes right i am she may mean no harm by saying it but that doesnt mean it doesnt do harm regardless and now people arent allowed to touch each other due to the coronavirus going around but at this point who cares i never got physical affection before anyway why would i worry about it now at least thats what i tell myself and others i laugh it off i respect others wishes and space i brush it off and pretend like it doesnt hurt but it really really really does especially when i havent been shown any affection by the people who were supposed to care the most i remember reading an article on a life story he had a horrid childhood and almost died as a result of his parents neglecting him he mentioned how he remembered being a little boy in his crib and hed his eyes out when came by just because he wanted to be held but everyone ignored him id never cried after reading something like that before but i did im crying just writing about it now and i did because it struck a cord with me i cant remember anything really specific but i do know there were times all i wanted was to be held reassured by my parents like any child should be but i wasnt i was pushed away yelled at and called clingy and they were right i was i am and im sorry im really truly sorry im sorry wasnt shown enough love as child im sorry i dont have many real friends who understand my feelings im sorry i was wasnt even kept by the parents that actually created me and will probably never know them im sorry i ended up adopted by a family who didnt really care and im sorry all those things made me who i am i dont want to be clingy i never wanted to be im sorry i am i wish i wasnt i wish i wasnt me i wish i was dead and then

venting i was in a relationship for years and it ended last spring im over it it was the most serious id ever felt about someone we just mutually agreed to break it off and go other she helped me realize i go through if depression and i need to handle it so i am i think she cared about me more than anyone in my life ever had and now that its gone i feel empty its not one of those crawl back to her deals cause we just dont work together but now it feels like it meant way more to me than it ever did to her shortly after i moved out she literally got rid of all my stuff that i had to leave i explicitly told her my mom would come get it and some of it i wanted to have but she literally acted like i never mentioned that and just of it all i for the first time since i was a teenager cried my eyes out i cried so hard she sent me as a sorry like that covered anything my shoes dress clothes all gone it was so personal she will never realize how awful that was to do and it kills me inside how easily she did it she has no idea how that made me feel nor would she care a few months went by after i moved out and she forgot my birthday didnt even say anything until a few days after yet on her birthday literally weeks after i moved out i acknowledged hers once again this destroyed me a person who told me times they wanted to stay in touch and be friends cause of how close weve been for so long completely forgets i exist these events have led me to resent her and i hate it a month after i moved out she text that she was seeing someone i thought wow how fast then a few months later she fails to remember she told me that while texting me about some new dentist guy shes seeing how he had a daughter near the same age as mine making okay now i get it its easy to forget me and of my things when you have the hots for a new guy it made sense and yet again i think on all the time we spent together and things we did and wonder why did they mean more to me than her how can someone so easily of another and be so blind to what theyre doing ive had the worst luck of my life since i moved away i cant even begin none of you would believe it all i can do is shake my head and tell myself it has to get better this many bad things cant keep happening to a single person giving so much effort and trying so hard to succeed surely it has to end but here i am i feel resentment and regret towards her now i dont want to but its the actions after the ending to this day she never realize how much i sacrificed and gave up to be with her that i never fully recovered from my depression won and back then i didnt even realize it was depression i wish i had never been in the army either thats something else entirely today after years a friend told me basically i am just one of many said im not unique or special to them and said it in such a weird way and i realized they were distancing themselves from me what i felt about them was entirely different and i actually feel pain right now like im hurt and and i dont know what to do anymore my childhood was awful being beat to finding out your step dad kept a child porn stash while his best friend was sexually abusing his daughters i dont think ive ever told anyone about that just the i took my entire life has been violent im i dont have any life long friends or people that check on me other then my mother today i have realized i am truly alone hoping the goes out long enough for me to dry out and catch something good or positive right now im and barely getting by i think people use me until theyre no longer satisfied then of me im not even on a self pity trip i think its just what it is and im coming to terms ill never have the balls to end my own life i just cant do that and sometimes i envy people that can i dont need any hang in there dms or eye of the im just venting i dont have anyone to talk to or any way to give context of my life for anyone to understand anyways so im just saying what i have bottled inside
