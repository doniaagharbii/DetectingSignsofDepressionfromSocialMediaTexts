fuck left abusive relationship moved in with abusive family put on disability in april constant health issues and drs and labs with no answers except maybe slight b deficiency no immunity to mumps just got the booster yesterday pt for two different pains chiropractor x a week passed out twice in a week due to weight loss was last year and down to can't gain weight to save my life wake up every morning in constant pain and nausea making it hard to eat and have energy stopped talking to my father's side of the family due to the mental abuse but still pressured by my mom to fix things before my grandmother gets old and passes away fiance lost his job in september and hasn't been able to get another even with dropped charges lost our first pregnancy the same week struggled to get through first semester of medical billing classes online maxed out credit cards to pay rent and utilities can't pay cc bills piling up and medical bills in collections spent a quiet christmas together that turned to hell the day after when we had to put one of our cats to sleep due to heart failure which was traumatic to see and decide to end his suffering after two different vet offices almost ruined relatioship with mom she was on vacation and i felt like she needed to be aware of it because he was supposed to go to her next year can't afford pain meds or anything at this point my car is paid off but dead and needs work we can't afford just not sure if i can deal with this anymore lease is up at the end of march and we can't afford staying here rn but can't afford another deposit anywhere else no family in fl to stay with and can't afford relocation even if offered a job out of state trying to sell everything i own for as little as possible to get rid of the physical and emotional baggage and to pay rent utilities other debts pretty much exhausted everything and just wondering if this is the end of line for us i'm scared of ended up homeless and losing our pets they are the only thing we have rn really the only thing that gets me out of bed everyday to take care of them and love them with what little i have left in me losing my boy after christmas broke me completely and i just don't think next year or next decade is worth suffering through i don't want to deal with more doctors that won't find anything because most of it is probably stress related and they can't do anything about that i don't know if it's worth starting the classes i signed up for if we end up homeless and without a way for me to take my online classes i just don't know i'm scared and tired and can't continue living life this way every day feels like living hell my body is absolutely useless and i hate it i'm useless to everyone including myself and more of a burden than anythingthis isn't living

m i give up on making friends long post my life has really been on a complete downwards spiral ever since i was years old when i was everything was perfect i was involved in sports band had a best friend and many other friends let's go through a timeline of what's happened to me since then years old it's the first week of th grade and all my friends have left me for no reason including my best friend i sit alone all the time during lunch and walk around the field doing nothing during recess but i assume these people that no longer talk to me are just immature and try to think that they were taken out of my life for a good reason years old middle school has started yeah i'm still alone all the time i try to keep that same attitude i had before though years old i pulled out from the public school i was going to and decided to do an online program getting up at am five days a week and spending hours a day at school doing work i could do in hours felt pointless because i was getting a's in all of my classes and had no friends to hang out with oh and my parents got divorced this year lots of fighting right in front of me and lots of having to choose sides in certain situations definitely great things for me to see and great situations to put me in years old really nothing this year actually still okay doing online schooling still no friends though years old i'm still okay doing the online program because i know that being a freshman at a public school will be hell for someone like me however i finally try to get out there and make friends i join my local group with expectations that there will be some like minded kids that i can hang out with sometimes i thought that i had no social skills after having no friends for years it was sad to see these kids try and talk to others i was the biggest there and i'm an huge introvert i made no friends with them years old i'm desperate to find some friends i go back and forth all summer with the decision of doing online school again or going back to a public school for the first time in three years fear me and i decide to stay homeschooled for another year awful decision i spend the entire year sitting in my room crying and questioning why i'm even here on earth years old now i have to go back to public school now i do i try to find a friend group i sit with so many different lunch tables during the first few months of school i can't even remember everyone i sat with i'm not at any table i don't fit in at any of these tables my social skills are flat out embarrassing i'm almost ready to just give up on ever making friends in my life and just accept it as a fact three weeks ago three kids randomly started hanging out with me everyday at lunch they were so nice to me i thought it finally was over i felt happy for the first time in a long time they cut off contract with me two weeks ago for no reason and now walk past me without saying anything to me when i asked them why they did this they said i don't know softly and walked away this is why i've been crying all weekend and especially today i give up now on making friends,moderate,moderate,"since (0.06207330524921417), was

yes im clingy and im sorry ive always been the clingy type and ive always been criticized for it main reason i am such is because i wasnt shown hardly any physically affection when i was young i can barely recall my parents having ever hugged me as a child and even when they did it was usually awkward and knowing who they really are now makes me wonder if any of it was even genuine either way being clingy is not something society is fond of its as annoying stupid childish unnecessary etc and ive had people say it to me like my dad saying you shouldnt cling to your sister in law like that it gets on her nerves and she is the type to literally shake my hand off if i try to hold her hand so i eventually stopped trying a couple friends of mine dont like physically contact much so they are the type to actually push you off if you touch them like my one friend literally shouted nope and her hand away when i tried once and the other friend had to give me a talk about it after asking her mom how to approach me on the matter i get it not everyone likes that and i respect the people who dont even when they express it in a rude or manner but boy does it really add to my self hate even my one friend who doesnt mind it will say things like i know youre clingy and shes right i am she may mean no harm by saying it but that doesnt mean it doesnt do harm regardless and now people arent allowed to touch each other due to the coronavirus going around but at this point who cares i never got physical affection before anyway why would i worry about it now at least thats what i tell myself and others i laugh it off i respect others wishes and space i brush it off and pretend like it doesnt hurt but it really really really does especially when i havent been shown any affection by the people who were supposed to care the most i remember reading an article on a life story he had a horrid childhood and almost died as a result of his parents neglecting him he mentioned how he remembered being a little boy in his crib and hed his eyes out when came by just because he wanted to be held but everyone ignored him id never cried after reading something like that before but i did im crying just writing about it now and i did because it struck a cord with me i cant remember anything really specific but i do know there were times all i wanted was to be held reassured by my parents like any child should be but i wasnt i was pushed away yelled at and called clingy and they were right i was i am and im sorry im really truly sorry im sorry wasnt shown enough love as child im sorry i dont have many real friends who understand my feelings im sorry i was wasnt even kept by the parents that actually created me and will probably never know them im sorry i ended up adopted by a family who didnt really care and im sorry all those things made me who i am i dont want to be clingy i never wanted to be im sorry i am i wish i wasnt i wish i wasnt me i wish i was dead and then

venting i was in a relationship for years and it ended last spring im over it it was the most serious id ever felt about someone we just mutually agreed to break it off and go other she helped me realize i go through if depression and i need to handle it so i am i think she cared about me more than anyone in my life ever had and now that its gone i feel empty its not one of those crawl back to her deals cause we just dont work together but now it feels like it meant way more to me than it ever did to her shortly after i moved out she literally got rid of all my stuff that i had to leave i explicitly told her my mom would come get it and some of it i wanted to have but she literally acted like i never mentioned that and just of it all i for the first time since i was a teenager cried my eyes out i cried so hard she sent me as a sorry like that covered anything my shoes dress clothes all gone it was so personal she will never realize how awful that was to do and it kills me inside how easily she did it she has no idea how that made me feel nor would she care a few months went by after i moved out and she forgot my birthday didnt even say anything until a few days after yet on her birthday literally weeks after i moved out i acknowledged hers once again this destroyed me a person who told me times they wanted to stay in touch and be friends cause of how close weve been for so long completely forgets i exist these events have led me to resent her and i hate it a month after i moved out she text that she was seeing someone i thought wow how fast then a few months later she fails to remember she told me that while texting me about some new dentist guy shes seeing how he had a daughter near the same age as mine making okay now i get it its easy to forget me and of my things when you have the hots for a new guy it made sense and yet again i think on all the time we spent together and things we did and wonder why did they mean more to me than her how can someone so easily of another and be so blind to what theyre doing ive had the worst luck of my life since i moved away i cant even begin none of you would believe it all i can do is shake my head and tell myself it has to get better this many bad things cant keep happening to a single person giving so much effort and trying so hard to succeed surely it has to end but here i am i feel resentment and regret towards her now i dont want to but its the actions after the ending to this day she never realize how much i sacrificed and gave up to be with her that i never fully recovered from my depression won and back then i didnt even realize it was depression i wish i had never been in the army either thats something else entirely today after years a friend told me basically i am just one of many said im not unique or special to them and said it in such a weird way and i realized they were distancing themselves from me what i felt about them was entirely different and i actually feel pain right now like im hurt and and i dont know what to do anymore my childhood was awful being beat to finding out your step dad kept a child porn stash while his best friend was sexually abusing his daughters i dont think ive ever told anyone about that just the i took my entire life has been violent im i dont have any life long friends or people that check on me other then my mother today i have realized i am truly alone hoping the goes out long enough for me to dry out and catch something good or positive right now im and barely getting by i think people use me until theyre no longer satisfied then of me im not even on a self pity trip i think its just what it is and im coming to terms ill never have the balls to end my own life i just cant do that and sometimes i envy people that can i dont need any hang in there dms or eye of the im just venting i dont have anyone to talk to or any way to give context of my life for anyone to understand anyways so im just saying what i have bottled inside she couldve said happy birthday she made so many changes so fast right after i hit the door and here i was trying to be strong for her when really she couldve my my cat stays with her too i miss my
